"""Derive FraudShield input signals at claim ingestion.

The four boolean risk signals the scorer consumes must be populated on every
claim as it enters the system (see docs/FRAUDSHIELD_PRODUCTION_DATA.md §2.3),
otherwise the trained model is blind to those features. This module is the single
place that derivation happens, so ingestion and any future feed share one
implementation.

Two signals come straight from the source system (`has_biometric`,
`prescription_after_service`); two are derived from reference data
(`chronic_drug_no_condition` from items × member conditions, `syndicate_signal`
from provider risk). Each derived rule is a transparent, auditable heuristic —
swap `syndicate_signal` for a real network/graph detector when one exists.
